# The Evolution of Commercial Passenger Aircraft, 1932-2020

This dataset is the outcome of my PhD thesis entitled “How Product Designs Evolve”. This census examined the production records and detailed specifications of 283 different aircraft models produced between 1932 and 2020. In this period, 53 distinct manufacturers produced a total of 54,793 airframes, each destined for commercial passenger transportation. This data makes it possible to trace the development of flight technology, from the age of flying boats and piston engines to the emergence of turbojets, turboprops, supersonic airliners, and the modern era of narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. Each aircraft model entry provides detailed specifications across 55 different variables, providing detailed information into model specifications, manufacturer details, role, basic configuration, passenger and cargo capacities, performance metrics, propulsion types, avionics, fuel efficiency, and engine emissions.

| **Purpose:**            | The Census of Airliner Technology traces the evolution of passenger aircraft technology. It comprises two separate but complementary tables. The first covers the historic production of airframes destined for commercial passenger transportation since 1932. The second covers the model specifications of the airframes produced in the period. |
