# The Evolution of Commercial Passenger Aircraft, 1932-2020

This dataset is the outcome of my PhD thesis entitled “How Product Designs Evolve”. This census examined the production records and detailed specifications of 283 different aircraft models produced between 1932 and 2020. In this period, 53 distinct manufacturers produced a total of 54,793 airframes, each destined for commercial passenger transportation. This data makes it possible to trace the development of flight technology, from the age of flying boats and piston engines to the emergence of turbojets, turboprops, supersonic airliners, and the modern era of narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. Each aircraft model entry provides detailed specifications across 55 different variables, providing detailed information into model specifications, manufacturer details, role, basic configuration, passenger and cargo capacities, performance metrics, propulsion types, avionics, fuel efficiency, and engine emissions.

* **Fly-by-Wire**: This column indicates whether the aircraft uses a fly-by-wire control system, where the pilot's inputs are transmitted to the flight control surfaces electronically, rather than mechanically.
* **Digital Diagnostic Systems**: This refers to the onboard systems used for monitoring and diagnosing the aircraft's health and performance.
* **Cockpit**: This column categorizes the aircraft's cockpit based on its avionics and instrumentation system. The EFIS category stands for Electronic Flight Instrument System, which indicates a modern cockpit with digital multi-function displays for flight data. Electromechanical signifies a traditional cockpit with analog gauges and instruments, prevalent in older aircraft models and simpler aircraft.
